        "guidelines": [
          "Storage should not exceed 24 hours to prevent nutrient degradation and odors",
          "Human and animal contact must be minimized; vegetables should never be irrigated",

        "vsBlackwater": "The distinction centers on contamination: blackwater contacts urine and fecal matter from toilets and kitchen sources, making it difficult to filter. Greywater from washing machines, showers, and bathroom sinks avoids fecal contamination, allowing safe filtering and garden reuse."
