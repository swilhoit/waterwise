    "totalStates": 50,
    "summary": "This comprehensive directory reveals a complex patchwork of greywater regulations across the United States, with approximately 30 states having formal greywater policies while 20 states either prohibit such systems or lack specific regulations. Western and Southwestern states lead in progressive greywater frameworks, driven by water scarcity concerns and conservation goals. Arizona pioneered the tiered permit approach allowing systems under 400 gallons per day without permits, while California permits simple washing machine systems without permits for qualifying installations. Eastern and Midwest states generally maintain more restrictive approaches, with states like Illinois and Indiana effectively prohibiting greywater reuse entirely. The regulatory landscape continues evolving rapidly, with Colorado implementing major changes in 2024-2026 shifting to a statewide opt-out system, and several states developing new frameworks as water conservation becomes increasingly critical for sustainable development."

      "permitExplanation": "Greywater systems in Alabama are evaluated individually by the Department of Environmental Management. There's no standard permit process - you'll need to submit an application and work with ADEM staff to determine if your proposed system can be approved.

Systems must exclude kitchen and dishwasher water and use only subsurface distribution methods. Alaska's approach balances environmental protection with practical water conservation needs, particularly important given the state's unique climate and infrastructure challenges in many remote communities.",
      "permitExplanation": "Alaska requires plumbing permits for all greywater systems, regardless of size. The good news: permit fees are very affordable ($1.50-$10.00).

The state allows diverse uses including household gardening, composting, and landscape irrigation, reflecting Arizona's leadership in water conservation driven by chronic water scarcity in the Sonoran Desert.

Properties within 300 feet of municipal sewer systems must connect rather than use alternative systems. This regulatory ambiguity leaves Arkansas residents without clear guidance for implementing greywater conservation systems, representing a significant gap in the state's environmental policy framework.",

State regulations only address greywater in the context of composting toilets, requiring it still go through conventional septic treatment.

The state permits both indoor reuse (toilet/urinal flushing) and outdoor applications including subsurface irrigation and surface irrigation with mulch cover. Recent regulatory updates include Direct Potable Reuse regulations effective October 2024, demonstrating California's commitment to expanding water recycling capabilities during ongoing drought concerns. The framework balances public health protection with practical water conservation needs across the state's diverse climate zones.",
      "permitExplanation": "California allows simple laundry-to-landscape systems WITHOUT a permit when you meet 13 conditions: single-family home, washing machine discharge only, subsurface or mulch-basin irrigation, and following safety guidelines. This makes it easy for most homeowners to install a basic greywater system themselves. More complex systems (multiple fixtures, indoor reuse, or larger capacity) require a plumbing permit - typically $50-$200 depending on your jurisdiction. Treatment systems that recycle water for toilet flushing need more extensive permits.",

Currently, local governments must actively choose to allow greywater systems, but the new law reverses this to require active opt-out decisions, dramatically expanding access across the state. This change reflects Colorado's recognition of greywater's importance for water conservation in the arid West, though systems must still comply with complex water rights laws that govern Colorado River Basin allocations. The transition represents one of the most significant greywater policy changes in recent U.S. history.",
      "permitExplanation": "Colorado is in a major transition period. Until January 1, 2026, greywater is only legal if your local government has specifically opted-in to allow it. After January 2026, greywater will be legal statewide unless your local government opts-out. Check with your city/county to see if greywater is currently allowed in your area.

This indoor-only approach administered through the Tennessee Plumbing Code reflects conservative public health policies that prioritize pathogen control over water conservation benefits. The restriction is particularly notable given Tennessee's vulnerability to drought impacts on the Tennessee River system and municipal water supplies, representing a missed opportunity for outdoor irrigation that could reduce potable water demands during dry periods while maintaining indoor public health protection.",
