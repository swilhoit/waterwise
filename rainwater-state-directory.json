    "summary": "Rainwater harvesting is legal in all 50 US states, though regulations vary significantly. Western states like Colorado and Utah have historically restricted collection due to water rights concerns, but have relaxed rules in recent years. States like Texas, Virginia, Arizona, and Rhode Island actively encourage rainwater harvesting through tax credits and rebates. Most states have no restrictions on residential rainwater collection for outdoor irrigation, while indoor and potable use may require permits or professional design in some jurisdictions."
